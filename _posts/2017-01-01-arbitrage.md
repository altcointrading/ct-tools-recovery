This was posted on the bitcoin trading subreddit /r/bitcoinmarkets.

Other algo-experienced redditors chimed in. If you are interested [here's link to the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/5lbxbn/it_might_be_time_to_start_algo_trading_again/).

They point out the usual problem - you need to have cash on exchanges which is a big counterparty risk and honestly, the arb won't pay off enough if you don't keep there alot of money. You might be risking ten grand to earn a dollar. Also, if the opportunity keeps occuring in one direction only (for instance buy on BTC-e and sell on Kraken) and you don't have a cheap way to get fiat out you're pretty much stranded.

> **_jstanley**: Another issue is inter-exchange transfers. If you want to buy Bitcoin on OKCoin and sell it on Bitfinex then you need to have USD (for example) on hand at OKCoin, and BTC on hand at Bitfinex. Keeping cash on hand at the exchanges is fine, except as soon as you've done that trade, you now have BTC at OKCoin and USD at Bitfinex, so you'd better either hope the next opportunity you come across is in the opposite direction, or transfer the USD and the BTC between the two exchanges.
