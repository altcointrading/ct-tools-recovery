description:  Highcharts are popular Javascript charts that have stock extension. These charts are sort of commercial but easy to use, often used by bitcoin exchanges. The disadvantage is the source of data can be obscured if the data is not supposed to be available.

<p>Take for instance OkCoin, the Chinese spot and futures exchange. Unlike Bitfinex, they don’t provide API access to their lending data and trader sentiment. The data is still available though, but only for a few hours in form of a chart on their website.</p>

<p>Bitfinex on the other hand has this data public. You can take a look at them at <a href="http://bfxdata.com">bfxdata.com</a> but don’t misinterpret: Bitfinex doesn’t provide the information on which pair the funding was used. BTC funding might be used to short BTC or long LTC and ETH. USD funding might be used for longs on BTCUSD but also on LTCUSD and ETHUSD. You should take into account the approximate market share of each.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, Okcoin provides none of such data. Just the chart.</p>

<p>Luckily, it is possible to scrape SVG charts - like the one that OKcoin uses. If you are up for the challenge. There is a package for that in R language.</p>

<p>Alternatively, there are graph reading software packages. You load an image, click somewhere, it reads up the coordinates of where you clicked. It is the easiest way but probably not feasible for continuous data collection. <a href="#graph-reading-packages">See here list of available packages</a></p>

<h2 id="chart-scraping-in-r">Chart scraping in R</h2>

<p>R language has a package called <strong>digitize</strong> that can recognize lines and chart patterns and read the data as coordinated. It was implemented into some graphic software packages (<a href="#graph-reading-packages">here</a>) but if you want it modular you will need to use the backage itself and fine tune it.</p>

<p>Here is a paper with how-to and use cases:
<a href="https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-1/RJournal_2011-1_Poisot.pdf">”The digitize Package: Extracting Numerical Data from Scatterplots”</a>.</p>

<p>The package used to be available from the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">archive network</a>, but it has been a long time since the last update. At some point it was abandoned and archived.</p>

<p>Now you can get the package <a href="https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=594">here on r-forge updated in 2011</a> or from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/digitize/">CRAN Archive</a>.</p>

<p>There are few problems:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Digitize depends on another archived package ReadImages which cannot be loaded in R 3.0.2 , because (I suspect) it doesn’t have a NAMESPACE. Likewise digitize fails to load under R 3.0.2.</p>

<p>It is not completely off to know R. It’s a laguage built for data processing and statistics. It’s been used by quants since always. And all datasets from Quandl.com can be imported into it with one line of code.</p>
